# InfiniteDivisibleKernels
Measures of Entropy from Data Using Infinitely Divisible Kernels | Parallel Implementation

As first version we implemented 3 main parts.

1) Compute standarNormalization
2) Compute GramMatrix with Gaussian Kernel over Pairwise distance between each pair of row data. 
3) Compute Eigen values from GramMatrix using Jacobi rotation algorinth (this works well with small datasets)

As future version we will code another method to compute eigen values.
